Guide: Building Your Visual Terraform Editor SaaS
This document outlines the steps, architecture, and technologies required to transform the single-file visual editor into a robust, multi-user SaaS application.

1. Recommended Technology Stack
To build a scalable and maintainable application, a modern tech stack is essential.

Frontend: React.js with TypeScript.

Why: React is perfect for building complex, interactive user interfaces like your editor. TypeScript adds static typing, which catches errors early and makes the code more robust and easier to refactor. You can use a framework like Next.js for a more feature-rich setup including server-side rendering.

UI Library: Keep using Blockly for the core editor. For the surrounding UI, consider a component library like MUI or Chakra UI.

Backend: Spring Boot with Java or Kotlin.

Why: As you suggested, Spring Boot is an excellent choice. It's highly scalable, secure, and has a massive ecosystem. Its robust nature is ideal for handling business logic, user data, and integrations with services like Git and Stripe.

Database: PostgreSQL.

Why: A powerful, open-source, and highly reliable relational database that works seamlessly with Spring Boot via Spring Data JPA. It's well-suited for storing user information, projects, and application state.

Authentication: Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Why: Spring Security is the standard for securing Spring applications. JWTs are a stateless, secure way to handle user sessions in a modern API-driven application, which is perfect for a separate frontend and backend.

Payments: Stripe.

Why: Stripe has excellent developer APIs, great documentation, and is the industry standard for integrating payments for SaaS subscriptions.

Deployment: Docker & AWS (ECS or EKS).

Why: Docker allows you to package your frontend and backend into portable containers. AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) are managed services that make it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your containerized application.

2. Project Setup & File Structure
You would structure your project as a monorepo (one repository containing both frontend and backend) or two separate repositories. Here’s a typical monorepo structure:

visual-terraform-saas/
├── backend/                 # Spring Boot Application
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main/
│   │   │   ├── java/com/yourcompany/terraformsaas/
│   │   │   │   ├── config/          # Security, CORS, etc.
│   │   │   │   ├── controller/      # API endpoints (REST Controllers)
│   │   │   │   ├── model/           # User, Project entities (JPA)
│   │   │   │   ├── repository/      # Database interaction (Spring Data)
│   │   │   │   ├── service/         # Business logic (Git, Stripe)
│   │   │   │   └── TerraformSaaSApplication.java
│   │   │   └── resources/
│   │   │       ├── application.properties
│   │   │       └── static/
│   ├── build.gradle         # Or pom.xml for Maven
│
├── frontend/                # React Application
│   ├── public/
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/      # Reusable React components (Editor, Sidebar)
│   │   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   │   ├── pages/           # Main pages (Dashboard, Editor, Pricing)
│   │   ├── services/        # API call functions (axios)
│   │   ├── state/           # State management (Redux/Zustand)
│   │   ├── App.tsx
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── package.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
│
├── .gitignore
└── docker-compose.yml       # For local development

3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Step 1: Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
Initialize Project: Use the Spring Initializr to create a new project with the following dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, PostgreSQL Driver.

User Authentication:

Create a User entity with fields like id, username, email, password.

Implement UserDetailsService and use BCryptPasswordEncoder to hash passwords.

Set up Spring Security configuration to protect endpoints and use a JWT filter to validate tokens on each request.

Create a AuthController with endpoints for /register and /login.

Git Integration:

Add the org.eclipse.jgit library to your dependencies.

Create a GitService that can clone, commit, push, and pull repositories on the server's file system. Your API controllers will call this service.

Security Note: Be extremely careful to sanitize all inputs to prevent command injection attacks.

Stripe Integration:

Add the Stripe Java library.

Create a PaymentController with an endpoint like /api/payments/create-subscription. This endpoint will create a Stripe Checkout session and return the session ID to the frontend.

Create a webhook endpoint (/api/webhooks/stripe) to listen for events from Stripe (e.g., checkout.session.completed) to update the user's subscription status in your database.

Step 2: Frontend Setup (React)
Initialize Project: Use npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript.

Refactor: Convert the existing HTML and JavaScript into React components. The main TerraformBlock class and Blockly logic can be moved into a custom React hook (e.g., useBlocklyEditor).

API Service: Create a service layer (e.g., using axios) to make authenticated requests to your Spring Boot backend.

Routing: Use react-router-dom to create different pages for login, registration, the dashboard, the editor, and pricing/subscription pages.

State Management: Use a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit to manage global state, such as the logged-in user and the current project.

Stripe Integration: Use the @stripe/react-stripe-js library. When a user clicks "Subscribe," call your backend to create a checkout session and then redirect the user to the Stripe-hosted checkout page.

Step 3: Deployment
Dockerize:

Create a Dockerfile for the Spring Boot backend.

Create a Dockerfile for the React frontend (use a multi-stage build with Nginx to serve the static files).

Local Development: Use docker-compose.yml to easily run your backend, frontend, and a PostgreSQL database on your local machine.

Cloud Deployment (AWS ECS):

Push your Docker images to a container registry like Amazon ECR.

Set up a VPC, Subnets, and an ECS Cluster.

Create Task Definitions for your frontend and backend services.

Create ECS Services to run and manage your tasks.

Set up an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to your services (e.g., /api/* to the backend, everything else to the frontend).

Use AWS RDS for a managed PostgreSQL database.

This guide provides a high-level but comprehensive roadmap. Each step involves significant development work, but following this structure will lead to a professional, scalable, and secure SaaS application.
